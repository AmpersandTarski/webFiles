# wiki-materials
This repo contains files to which we want to refer from pages in [https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/ampersand/wiki]

It is intended to be a store for files, not as a sort of FTP-site in which files need to be organized in a way that accommodates non-authors of the wiki.
Therefore, it is suggested that you maintain your files in a directory of your own.
Only after a clear consensus has been reached (to be documented in this readme file), should other directories be made.

Note that you should only move or delete files from this repo if you are sure that all links in the wiki that refer to those files, are changed or deleted accordingly.
