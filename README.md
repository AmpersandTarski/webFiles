# wiki-materials
This repo contains files to which we want to refer from pages in [https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/ampersand/wiki]

Its first intention is to act as a store for files that are referred to from the Wiki from all sorts of places.
To do so efficiently, it is suggested that
- every author maintains a directory of his own, in which he can store pictures and other 'irregular' stuff.
- a directory is created for each kind of content that we would expect to find 'together'. 
  An example of this would be 'literature'. 

We expect anyone that stores content in this repo will see to it that the stored content will be appropriately maintained. Files should only be moved or deleted if you are sure that all links in the wiki that refer to those files, are changed or deleted accordingly.
