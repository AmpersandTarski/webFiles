## Binary versions of Ampersand

In this directory we keep binary versions of ampersand. These versions are linked to from the [ampersand documentation](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/documentation), as a convienience service to users. 

Please add a file VERSION.txt at every release, containing the output of `ampersand --version` 

Currently the binaries are not built automatically, because we do not know how to cross compile. (It would be great to have something like that, so then we could use travis-ci to build these binaries. Maybe someday someone tells us how to do that!)
